# Textpattern CMS help files

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/textpattern-cms-textpacks/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/textpattern-cms-textpacks)

This repository contains Inline Help text files (aka 'Pophelp') for [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com).

## Contributing

Every translated help text makes Textpattern better! **Translation of the project is achieved via [Crowdin](https://translate.textpattern.com/)** - the tools they provide make translating as painless as possible. Please create a Crowdin account (it's free), select the language you want to translate to from the listing (they each show the percentage already completed) and off you go!

**Please note that we do not accept pull requests directly to this GitHub repository** (this is just a storage area for the languages generated by our Crowdin build).
